# How to Create an R Package

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

While the `mypackage` package calculates columns and row variances for a
matrix in R, this GitHub page and documents are meant to providie a
minimal working example and walkthrough for how to create an R package.
The main walkthrough is provided in the R_Package_Presentation.pptx powerpoint and
relies heavily on [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) by
Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan. This workshop shortens the contents of
the book into a 45 minute presentation.
