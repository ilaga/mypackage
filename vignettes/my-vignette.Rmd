```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

So you want to calculate column and row variances of your matrix, but are frustrated that `rowVars` doesn't exist? Well look no further. First, let's load `mypackage`.

```{r setup}
library(mypackage)
```

Now to calculate those pesky row and column variances, just use the `colVars` and `rowVars` functions!

```{r}
mat <- rbind(
  c(1, 2, 7),
  c(3, 5, 9),
  c(5, 6, 1)
)

rowVars(mat)
colVars(mat)

```

Isn't that neat?
