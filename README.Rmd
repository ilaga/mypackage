# How to Create an R Package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

While the `mypackage` package calculates columns and row variances for a matrix in R, this GitHub page and documents are meant to providie a minimal working example and walkthrough for how to create an R package. The main walkthrough is provided in the Walkthrough.pdf powerpoint and relies heavily on [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan. This workshop shortens the contents of the book into a 45 minute presentation.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("devtools","roxygen2", "usethis"))
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)
library(usethis)


```
